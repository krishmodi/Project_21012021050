==> any challenges faced?

"In the initial stages of my project, I found designing the user interface to be a relatively straightforward task. 
However, as I progressed, I encountered challenges when it came to data entry. 
I wasn't sure how to upload a large volume of movie data. 
That's when I discovered the Postman website, which provides pre-generated APIs. 
I integrated one of these APIs into my application, which allowed me to efficiently populate my database with movie information.

While developing the application, I encountered a persistent bug that was quite frustrating. 
Whenever I clicked on a particular movie, the application would redirect me to a different movie. 
After thorough debugging, I eventually identified the issue and realized where I had made a mistake in my code. 
This experience taught me valuable lessons throughout the development process."
