## Technologies Used

List the technologies, libraries, and tools used in your Kotlin Android Weather App:

- Kotlin: The core programming language driving Android app development, known for its efficiency and versatility.
- Android Studio: The official integrated development environment (IDE) chosen for crafting the app, equipped with a comprehensive suite of tools for efficient development.
- Postman API: The reliable source of weather data, powering the app with accurate forecasts and real-time conditions.

## Challenges Faced

Challenges During Development are below. This may include issues related to API integration, animation rendering, app performance, or any other difficulties you faced.

- **Challenge 1**: Reagarding API integration.
- **Challenge 2**: User friendly animation-related difficulties.
- **Challenge 3**: Detail any other development hurdles.

## How Challenges Were Overcome

Explain how each challenge was successfully addressed, providing insights into your strategies, workarounds, and lessons learned:

- "In the initial stages of my project, I found designing the user interface to be a relatively straightforward task. 
However, as I progressed, I encountered challenges when it came to data entry. 
I wasn't sure how to upload a large volume of movie data. 
That's when I discovered the Postman website, which provides pre-generated APIs. 
I integrated one of these APIs into my application, which allowed me to efficiently populate my database with movie information.

- While developing the application, I encountered a persistent bug that was quite frustrating. 
Whenever I clicked on a particular movie, the application would redirect me to a different movie. 
After thorough debugging, I eventually identified the issue and realized where I had made a mistake in my code. 
This experience taught me valuable lessons throughout the development process."

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to get started with your Movie Rater App. This should include prerequisites and installation steps.

### Prerequisites

List the software, tools, and dependencies users need to have installed before using your application:

- Android Studio with Kotlin support
- An Postman API key(already Genrated)
- Any other specific prerequisites

### Installation 

Guide users through the process of installing your application:

```shell
# Add instructions for obtaining the OpenWeather API key
- For generating API key visit OpenWeatherApi webite there you can generate it easily.

# Build and run the project in Android Studio
- After building the project in Android studio it will generate an debug.apk file with metadata.json.
```
### Uses

**Using the Weather App is simple and intuitive**.

- Movie Exploration: Users can visit your platform to explore a vast collection of movies. They can search for specific titles, browse by genre, or discover new releases. Each movie is presented with a detailed page showcasing information like plot summaries, cast and crew, ratings, and trailers.

- User Registration and Profiles: To enhance the user experience, individuals can create accounts and profiles. This allows them to save their favorite movies, keep track of their viewing history, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences.
